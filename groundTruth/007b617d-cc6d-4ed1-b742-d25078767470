PRO FOOTBALL;Meeting <PRESIDENT>President</PRESIDENT|Bill_Clinton> Is a Cowboy Habit

<PRESIDENT>President</PRESIDENT|Bill_Clinton> Clinton greeted the Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys for the third time at the White House today and picked up a casual endorsement from the team owner, Jerry Jones.

"Ever since Bill Clinton got <PRESIDENT>elected President of the United States</PRESIDENT|Bill_Clinton>, the Dallas Cowboys have been winning Super Bowls," said Jones, whose team also won the title in 1993 and 1994. "We've got to get Bill Clinton re-elected."

The Atlanta Braves, who won their first World Series last fall, will get a belated White House meeting with the <PRESIDENT>President</PRESIDENT|Bill_Clinton> on Feb. 26. Officials said that Bosnian peace negotiations and the battle over the Federal budget had delayed the customary post-World Series meeting between <PRESIDENT>the President</PRESIDENT|Bill_Clinton> and the winning team.
