How to Understand Bush's Attacks on Clinton; Can He Send Others?

To the Editor:

Gov. Bill Clinton is not the only person who had mixed feelings about the Vietnam War. Like thousands of other young men, I served during that war, and I understand what Bill Clinton went through as a young man more than two decades ago.

However, what makes his position unusual is that now he wants to be <PRESIDENT>President</PRESIDENT|Bill_Clinton> and become our <PRESIDENT>Commander in Chief</PRESIDENT|Bill_Clinton>. Therefore, the big question is this: How could Bill Clinton as <PRESIDENT>President</PRESIDENT|Bill_Clinton> justify sending young men to war, for any reason, when he did everything possible not to go himself?
