<CONTENT><PRESIDENT entity="Bill_Clinton">President</PRESIDENT> Clinton greeted the Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys for the third time at the White House today and picked up a casual endorsement from the team owner, Jerry Jones.

"Ever since Bill Clinton got <PRESIDENT entity="Bill_Clinton">elected President of the United States</PRESIDENT>, the Dallas Cowboys have been winning Super Bowls," said Jones, whose team also won the title in 1993 and 1994. "We've got to get Bill Clinton re-elected."

The Atlanta Braves, who won their first World Series last fall, will get a belated White House meeting with <PRESIDENT entity="Bill_Clinton">the President</PRESIDENT> on Feb. 26. Officials said that Bosnian peace negotiations and the battle over the Federal budget had delayed the customary post-World Series meeting between <PRESIDENT entity="Bill_Clinton">the President</PRESIDENT> and the winning team.
