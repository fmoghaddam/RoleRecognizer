A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said yesterday that <KING entity="">QUEEN</KING> ELIZABETH II and other <ROLE entity="">members of the royal family</ROLE> are discussing possible changes in Britain's 1,200-year-old monarchy. The palace refused to specify what issues the <KING entity="">70-year-old queen</KING>, her husband, <KING entity="">PRINCE</KING> PHILIP, and <KING entity="">the heir to the throne</KING>, <KING entity="">PRINCE</KING> CHARLES, have taken up in their talks with senior aides.

A tabloid newspaper, The Sun, reported that they include ending the public financing of royalty, modernizing the rules on who succeeds to the throne and allowing royalty to marry Roman Catholics.

''The discussion of strategic issues goes on regularly in this as in other organizations,'' said a spokeswoman for the palace, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.

The Sun said the discussions could lead to the end of payments from the public purse to <KING entity="">the Queen</KING>, her husband and <KING entity="">QUEEN </KING>ELIZABETH <ROLE entity="">the Queen Mother</ROLE>. Those payments amount to $13 million a year.

But <ROLE entity="">the royal family members</ROLE> aren't exactly planning to take night jobs. Instead of the public payments, they would want the $142 million a year in revenue generated by the Crown Estates, which <KING entity="">King</KING> George III surrendered in 1760, the newspaper said. George III agreed to give up income from the estates in return for a sum from the public purse determined by Parliament.

The Sun reported that <ROLE entity="">the royal family</ROLE> is also considering proposals to remove <KING entity="">the monarch</KING> as temporal head of the Church of England, and to give women equal rights as <KING entity="">heirs to the throne</KING>. Currently, <KING entity="">the monarch</KING> is succeeded by his or her eldest son, whose own son is next in line for <KING entity="">the throne</KING> before any of his sisters. Younger sons and their children are next in line, followed by any daughters of <KING entity="">the monarch</KING>.

Among the most significant of the changes reported to be under consideration is a proposal to let royalty marry Roman Catholics without losing their position in the line of succession.
