WASHINGTON, Dec. 14â€” <PRESIDENT entity="George_H._W._Bush">President-elect</PRESIDENT> Bush today specified the role that he sees for Dan Quayle, the man who will occupy the job Mr. Bush held for the eight years.

''It's going to be very much like the Reagan-Bush relationship,'' Mr. Bush told reporters, saying that he would seek the advice of his <ROLE entity="Dan_Quayle">Vice President</ROLE>.

Mr. Bush said that one task might be to head a study group on regulatory relief, a duty Mr. Bush undertook for Mr. Reagan. Mr. Bush said that he was uncertain if Mr. Quayle would be in charge of crisis management, a position Mr. Bush held under <PRESIDENT entity="Ronald_Reagan">President</PRESIDENT> Reagan. Mr. Bush said the position amounted only to heading meetings of the National Security Council in Mr. Reagan's absence and was not a key policy position.

Mr. Bush said those who might regard the Vice President's role as relatively minor are missing the point.

''They just don't understand that the importance of the <ROLE entity="Dan_Quayle">Vice Presidency</ROLE> has emerged and one of the reasons it has emerged is that <ROLE entity="Dan_Quayle">the Vice President</ROLE> is a generalist, has the confidence of <PRESIDENT entity="George_H._W._Bush">the President</PRESIDENT>,'' he said.
